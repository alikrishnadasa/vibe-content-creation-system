# Video Clip Contextualizer PRD
## AI-Powered Semantic Video-to-Script Matching System

### Executive Summary

An AI system that analyzes video clips of configurable length and matches them with corresponding voiceover scripts using semantic understanding. The system uses state-of-the-art video analysis models to understand visual content and match it with text descriptions in real-time.

**Key Goals:**
- 85% accuracy in semantic matching
- Sub-500ms processing per clip (up to 10 seconds)
- Support for variable clip lengths (0.5-30 seconds)
- 10,000+ concurrent users

---

## Problem Statement

Content creators spend 4-6 hours manually matching voiceovers to video segments. Current solutions rely on basic timestamp alignment or manual review, resulting in:
- High labor costs ($2-5K per project)
- Slow turnaround (2-3 days)
- Inconsistent quality (15% error rate)
- Limited scalability

---

## Solution Overview

### Core Functionality

1. **Video Analysis Pipeline**
   - Object detection and tracking
   - Action recognition
   - Scene understanding
   - Temporal relationship modeling

2. **Semantic Matching Engine**
   - Multimodal embeddings for video and text
   - Confidence scoring with explainability
   - Real-time processing with caching

3. **Flexible Architecture**
   - Configurable clip duration (0.5-30 seconds)
   - Sliding window analysis for longer videos
   - Batch and stream processing modes

### BLIP-2 for Video Captioning
BLIP-2 generates natural language descriptions of visual content. In our system:
- Processes video frames to create scene descriptions
- Provides additional context for matching
- Helps explain why matches were made
- Can generate accessibility descriptions

### Clip Length Modularity
```python
class VideoProcessor:
    def __init__(self, clip_duration=5.0, overlap=0.5):
        self.clip_duration = clip_duration
        self.overlap = overlap
    
    def process_video(self, video_path, script):
        # Dynamic segmentation based on config
        segments = self.segment_video(video_path)
        
        # Process each segment
        results = []
        for segment in segments:
            features = self.extract_features(segment)
            match = self.match_to_script(features, script)
            results.append(match)
        
        return self.merge_results(results)
