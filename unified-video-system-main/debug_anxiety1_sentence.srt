00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Your anxiety never actually goes away, does it?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Even when lives going good, you're still anxious about something.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I totally get it.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I used to think anxiety was about external stuff, money problems, relationship drama, career stress.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But I became a monk and realized something deep.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Anxiety isn't really about what's happening around you.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's about not knowing who you actually are.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When you think you're just this random body in a meaningless universe, of course you're gonna be anxious.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Everything feels scary and urgent because you think this is all you get.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But you're not this body.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're an eternal soul and your natural state is to love Krishna.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When you don't know this, it's like having amnesia and trying to navigate life without knowing your own identity.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's terrifying, right?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Your anxiety is basically your soul saying, I don't know who I am or what I'm supposed to be doing here.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When you start understanding your meant to serve Krishna, anxiety naturally decreases because you have this unshakable foundation.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're not just some random organism trying to survive.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're a beloved soul with an eternal purpose.
