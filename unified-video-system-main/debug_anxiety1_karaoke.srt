Your anxiety never actually goes away, does it? Even when lives going good, you're still anxious about something. I totally get it. I used to think anxiety was about external stuff, money problems, relationship drama, career stress. But I became a monk and realized something deep. Anxiety isn't really about what's happening around you. It's about not knowing who you actually are. When you think you're just this random body in a meaningless universe, of course you're gonna be anxious. Everything feels scary and urgent because you think this is all you get. But you're not this body. You're an eternal soul and your natural state is to love Krishna. When you don't know this, it's like having amnesia and trying to navigate life without knowing your own identity. That's terrifying, right? Your anxiety is basically your soul saying, I don't know who I am or what I'm supposed to be doing here. When you start understanding your meant to serve Krishna, anxiety naturally decreases because you have this unshakable foundation. You're not just some random organism trying to survive. You're a beloved soul with an eternal purpose.

Your anxiety never actually goes away, does it? Even when lives going good, you're still anxious about something. I totally get it. I used to think anxiety was about external stuff, money problems, relationship drama, career stress. But I became a monk and realized something deep. Anxiety isn't really about what's happening around you. It's about not knowing who you actually are. When you think you're just this random body in a meaningless universe, of course you're gonna be anxious. Everything feels scary and urgent because you think this is all you get. But you're not this body. You're an eternal soul and your natural state is to love Krishna. When you don't know this, it's like having amnesia and trying to navigate life without knowing your own identity. That's terrifying, right? Your anxiety is basically your soul saying, I don't know who I am or what I'm supposed to be doing here. When you start understanding your meant to serve Krishna, anxiety naturally decreases because you have this unshakable foundation. You're not just some random organism trying to survive. You're a beloved soul with an eternal purpose.
