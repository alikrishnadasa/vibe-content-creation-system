1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your anxiety

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
never actually

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
goes away,

4
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,000
does it?

5
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Even when

6
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
lives going

7
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
good, you're

8
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
still anxious

9
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
about something.

10
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I totally

11
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
get it.

12
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I used

13
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to think

14
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
anxiety was

15
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
about external

16
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
stuff, money

17
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
problems, relationship

18
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
drama, career

19
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
stress. But

20
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I became

21
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a monk

22
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and realized

23
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
something deep.

24
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Anxiety isn't

25
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
really about

26
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
what's happening

27
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
around you.

28
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's about

29
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
not knowing

30
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
who you

31
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
actually are.

32
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When you

33
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
think you're

34
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
just this

35
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
random body

36
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in a

37
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
meaningless universe,

38
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
of course

39
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you're gonna

40
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
be anxious.

41
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everything feels

42
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
scary and

43
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
urgent because

44
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you think

45
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
this is

46
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
all you

47
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
get. But

48
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you're not

49
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
this body.

50
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're an

51
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
eternal soul

52
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and your

53
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
natural state

54
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is to

55
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
love Krishna.

56
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When you

57
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
don't know

58
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this, it's

59
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
like having

60
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
amnesia and

61
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
trying to

62
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
navigate life

63
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
without knowing

64
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
your own

65
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
identity. That's

66
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
terrifying, right?

67
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Your anxiety

68
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is basically

69
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
your soul

70
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
saying, I

71
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
don't know

72
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
who I

73
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
am or

74
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
what I'm

75
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
supposed to

76
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
be doing

77
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
here. When

78
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
you start

79
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
understanding your

80
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
meant to

81
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
serve Krishna,

82
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
anxiety naturally

83
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
decreases because

84
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you have

85
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
this unshakable

86
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
foundation. You're

87
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
not just

88
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
some random

89
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
organism trying

90
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to survive.

91
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're a

92
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
beloved soul

93
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
with an

94
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
eternal purpose.
