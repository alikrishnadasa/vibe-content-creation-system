1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Your anxiety never actually

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
goes away, does it?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Even when lives going

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
good, you're still anxious

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
about something. I totally

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
get it. I used

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to think anxiety was

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
about external stuff, money

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
problems, relationship drama, career

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
stress. But I became

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
a monk and realized

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
something deep. Anxiety isn't

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
really about what's happening

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
around you. It's about

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
not knowing who you

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
actually are. When you

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
think you're just this

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
random body in a

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
meaningless universe, of course

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you're gonna be anxious.

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everything feels scary and

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
urgent because you think

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
this is all you

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
get. But you're not

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
this body. You're an

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
eternal soul and your

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
natural state is to

28
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
love Krishna. When you

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
don't know this, it's

30
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
like having amnesia and

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
trying to navigate life

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
without knowing your own

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
identity. That's terrifying, right?

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Your anxiety is basically

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
your soul saying, I

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
don't know who I

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
am or what I'm

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
supposed to be doing

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
here. When you start

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
understanding your meant to

41
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
serve Krishna, anxiety naturally

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
decreases because you have

43
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
this unshakable foundation. You're

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
not just some random

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
organism trying to survive.

46
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're a beloved soul

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
with an eternal purpose.
